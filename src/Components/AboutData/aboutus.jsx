          So there’s this relatively new concept called ‘hackathon’. While in
          the IT world every trusted professional has already been to at least
          five of these, most of the people in other industries haven’t even
          heard about it. So there’s this relatively new concept called

          And that’s a pity. Because hackathons are a type of community-oriented
          events where professionals from different industries gather to solve
          an issue through tech solutions they get to come up with. Most of them
          have a theme, and you can either come with a team of your own or be
          paired with one. Because hackathons are a type of community-oriented

          you are a professional in the X industry. For the purposes of this
          article, this X will be law. You’re working in the legal industry.

          terrific IT professionals who are gifted and willing to show off their
          skills, maybe a product person who knows how to make a digital product
          market-fit and you’ve got yourself a winning chance. Aaaand in comes
